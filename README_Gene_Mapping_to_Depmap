README_Gene_Mapping_to_Depmap
Fredrik Wermeling, PhD

The script was developed and successfully executed using RStudio version 2024.12.0 Build 467 and R version 4.4.1, using the dplyr, readr, stringr, tidyr, and purrr R packages.

Overview
This R script takes a list of gene names and attempts to identify known synonyms as well as mouse/human orthologues. Next, the script filters these suggestions against a DepMap gene list, so that only matches present in DepMap are retained. This is particularly useful when working against the Depmap portal and its resources.

How to use
The script processes five input files. Save all files in a dedicated folder.

Gene List:
A plain text file listing gene names (one per line) for which you want to find synonyms and orthologues. For us this is typically a list of genes that are not matching to the Depmap

MRK_List1.rpt
A tab-delimited file containing gene synonyms from Jax.org. The script uses this to identify current marker symbols for genes.
Download from: https://www.informatics.jax.org/downloads/reports/index.html
Unzip and save into the dedicated folder.

HMD_HumanPhenotype.rpt
A tab-delimited file that maps mouse genes to their human orthologues.
Download from: https://www.informatics.jax.org/downloads/reports/index.html
Save it in the dedicated folder.

human+mouse synonym.txt
A text file containing additional synonyms for both mouse and human genes generated from Ensembl BioMart.
Download from: https://github.com/EsbjornHenkel/Green-Listed-V2/blob/main/libraries/human%2Bmouse%20synonym.txt
Save it in the dedicated folder.

depmap all.txt
A plain text file listing gene names present in the DepMap 24Q4 dataset. This file is used to filter the suggestions so that only those genes found in DepMap are output.
(Provide your own file or download it from an appropriate DepMap resource, e.g., https://depmap.org/portal/). A version of this is also attached to the script repository. Save it in the dedicated folder. Note that this file could be any gene list that you want to map your list again. Other examples are also uploaded to the repository, eg the Brunello or Brie libraries. For flexibility you need to change which column the gene symbols are found. In Brie and Brunello they are in column 2, while in the depmap all its in column 1.

Output
After processing, the script creates a new folder (named by the current date) within the same directory as your gene list file. This folder will contain two CSV files:

Detailed Mapping (detailed_gene_mapping.csv)
Lists each input gene along with its corresponding synonyms (from both MRK and human+mouse synonym sources) and mouse/human orthologues. Additional columns include:
DepMap_Matches: The unique union of suggestions that are present in the DepMap gene set.
Num_DepMap_Matches: The total number of unique DepMap matches found for that gene.

Condensed Mapping (condensed_depmap_mapping.csv)
A three-column file where each row contains the gene, one unique DepMap match, and the total number of unique matches (Num_Matches) for that gene. If no matches are found for a gene, the DepMap_Match cell is blank and Num_Matches is 0. This layout is convenient for copy-pasting or further analysis.

The number of total unique matches can be used as a filtering to get an idea of which identified mappings to continue with. 2-4 is likely advisable as if there are more, you´ve likely identified a whole gene family suggested as an orthologue to your input gene. It´s likely not these types of mappings that you are looking for.
